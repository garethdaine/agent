## Common Review Comments

### Code Style
```
Consider extracting this into a separate function for better readability.
This name doesn't clearly convey the purpose. Suggest: [alternative]
This logic could be simplified using [pattern/technique].
```

### Security
```
⚠️ SECURITY: User input must be validated before use.
⚠️ SECURITY: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
⚠️ SECURITY: Sensitive data should not be logged.
```

### Performance
```
Consider using [data structure] for O(1) lookup instead of O(n).
This could cause N+1 query problem. Consider batch loading.
Resource not properly closed - potential memory leak.
```

### Error Handling
```
Empty catch block silently swallows errors. Handle or log appropriately.
Error message exposes internal details. Use generic message for users.
Consider what happens if [operation] fails here.
```
